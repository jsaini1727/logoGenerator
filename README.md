# SVG Logo Maker

## User Story
```
AS a web developer, I coded a simple logo generator which I can use for various
projects that I will be doing in future without the hassle of hiring a graphic designer.
My journey to travel to Mars continues and now I am comfortable with the space-suit and
the feeling of weightlessness....

## Description

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword 
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword 
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
